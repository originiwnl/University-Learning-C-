Longer Version:
#include <iostream>
 
int main(){
    int n, rem;
 
    std::cout << "please enter a number" << std::endl;
    std::cin >> n;
 
    rem = n % 2;
 
    bool is_even;
    // yes/no (true/false) values have also a type, called bool
 
    is_even = (rem == 0);
    // read this right to left:
    // is the value of rem equal to 0?
    // store the corresponding yes/no answer
    // in the bool variable is_even
 
    // we wouldn't normally write this program like this
    // this is just to show what is going on with the yes/no values
    // and it will become more useful later on
 
    if(is_even){
        // in this condition we use a 
        // yes/no (bool) value 
        // previously computed
        // instead of a yes/no (bool) expression 
        // as in the previous example
 
        std::cout << "the number is even" << std::endl;
    }
    else{
        std::cout << "the number is odd" << std::endl;
    }
}

Shorter Version:
#include <iostream>
 
int main(){
    int n;
 
    std::cout << "please enter a number" << std::endl;
    std::cin >> n;
 
    // this version does two things within the condition of the if:
    // it first computes the remainder of the division of n by 2
    // then checks whether it is equal to 0 or not
 
    if((n % 2) == 0){
 
        std::cout << "the number is even" << std::endl;
 
    }
    else{
 
        std::cout << "the number is odd" << std::endl;
 
    }
}
